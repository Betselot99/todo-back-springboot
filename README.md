# Task Automation Application

## Overview

This project is a task automation application composed of a frontend, backend, and database. The goal is to implement a full-stack application, manage it with Git, and deploy it using CI/CD practices.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the application.
- **Backend**: API and business logic.
- **Database**: Data storage and retrieval.

## Objectives

1. **Repository Management**:
   - Create a repository on GitHub or GitLab.
   - Push the initial code to the main branch.
   - Create a feature branch for implementing new functionalities.

2. **Containerization**:
   - Independently containerize the frontend, backend, and database using Docker.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, integration, and deployment.
   - Ensure that any changes pushed to the main branch trigger the pipeline.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a server upon merging changes into the main branch.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on setup, usage, and deployment.

## Deliverables

### 1. **Git and Code Repository Management**
- **Repository Setup and Management**:  
  Create and manage the Git repository (create repository, push/pull code).
- **Branching Management**:  
  Implement branching strategies (create branches, push/pull across branches, merge branches, manage pull requests).
- **Merge Conflict Management**:  
  Handle and resolve merge conflicts as needed.

### 2. **Containerization**
- **Containerization of Application Components**:  
  Containerize all parts of the project (frontend, backend, and database).
- **Dockerfile Creation**:  
  Write Dockerfiles for each service (frontend, backend, database).
- **Docker Image Management**:  
  Build and manage Docker images for all services.
- **Docker Compose Setup**:  
  Use Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**:  
  Define and implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
- **Automation of Build and Tests**:  
  Automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code upon pushes or pull requests to the main branch.
- **Pipeline Triggering**:  
  Ensure any changes pushed to the main branch automatically trigger the pipeline for integration and deployment.

### 4. **Deployment to Server**
- **Deployment Automation**:  
  Create deployment scripts to automatically deploy the application to a server upon successful pipeline completion.
- **Server Setup**:  
  Configure the server to host the application and handle live deployments.

### 5. **Documentation**
- **Comprehensive Documentation**:  
  Provide technical documentation in the form of a `README.md` or other formats (e.g., Word document).
- **Detailed Instructions**:  
  Include setup instructions, usage, and deployment steps for developers and users.

## Bonus Opportunities

- Implement Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- Set up monitoring tools to track application performance.
- Use reverse proxies like Nginx to enhance routing and security.
